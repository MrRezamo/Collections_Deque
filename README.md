Deque Operations
This Python code performs a series of operations on a deque (double-ended queue). The user inputs the number of operations they wish to perform, followed by each operation as a string. The supported operations are:

append x: Add integer x to the right end of the deque.
appendleft x: Add integer x to the left end of the deque.
pop: Remove the rightmost element of the deque.
popleft: Remove the leftmost element of the deque.
The code uses the deque class from the collections module to create an empty deque, and then performs the requested operations on it. The final elements of the deque are printed to the console.

Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the Python script.
Run the script by entering python deque_operations.py.
Follow the prompts to input the number of operations and the details of each operation.
The script will output the final elements of the deque after performing all operations.
